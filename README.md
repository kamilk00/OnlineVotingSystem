# OnlineVotingSystem

The main goal of the project was to develop Online Voting System using ASP.NET MVC. 
The data is stored in a non-relational MongoDB database. The user of the application, depending on the permissions held, can vote, see future voting rounds, 
the results of completed voting rounds, and change the password of their account. The administrator may also manage users and voting rounds.
